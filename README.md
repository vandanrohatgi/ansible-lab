## Ansible lab

A docker lab to play around with Ansible. The lab contains one master container and 2 workers to execute ansible commands. 

PS: Do no use windows to launch this docker-compose file. It has bugs that prevent mounting folders to containers. Switch to a WSL terminal to use this project.

I have used my own keys in setting up SSH. Ansible can automatically setup SSH (which is what I will be using down the lane)
