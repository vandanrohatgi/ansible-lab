## continue this project from a proper linux OS

A docker lab to play around with Ansible. The lab contains one master container and 2 workers to execute ansible commands. 

PS: Do no use windows to launch this docker-compose file. It has bugs that prevent mounting fodlers to containers. Switch to a WSL teminal to use this project.
